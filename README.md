# Inference

The inference entrypoint script is `scripts/inference.py`. Before testing your cases, there are two preparations need to be completed:

1. [Download all required pretrained models](#download-pretrained-models).
2. [Prepare source image and driving audio pairs](#prepare-inference-data).
3. [Run inference](#run-inference).

## Download pretrained models

You can easily get all pretrained models required by inference from our [HuggingFace repo](https://huggingface.co/fudan-generative-ai/hallo).

Clone the the pretrained models into `${PROJECT_ROOT}/pretrained_models` directory by cmd below:

```shell
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/fudan-generative-ai/hallo pretrained_models
```

Or you can download them separately from their source repo:

- [hallo](https://huggingface.co/fudan-generative-ai/hallo/tree/main/hallo): Our checkpoints consist of denoising UNet, face locator, image & audio proj.
- [audio_separator](https://huggingface.co/huangjackson/Kim_Vocal_2): Kim\_Vocal\_2 MDX-Net vocal removal model by [KimberleyJensen](https://github.com/KimberleyJensen). (_Thanks to runwayml_)
- [insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/python-package#model-zoo): 2D and 3D Face Analysis placed into `pretrained_models/face_analysis/models/`. (_Thanks to deepinsight_)
- [face landmarker](https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task): Face detection & mesh model from [mediapipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker#models) placed into `pretrained_models/face_analysis/models`.
- [motion module](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff/blob/main/README.md#202309-animatediff-v2): motion module from [AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff). (_Thanks to guoyww_).
- [sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse): Weights are intended to be used with the diffusers library. (_Thanks to stablilityai_)
- [StableDiffusion V1.5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5): Initialized and fine-tuned from Stable-Diffusion-v1-2. (_Thanks to runwayml_)
- [wav2vec](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h): wav audio to vector model from [Facebook](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h).

Finally, these pretrained models should be organized as follows:

```text

|   `-- Kim_Vocal_2.onnx
|-- face_analysis/
|   `-- models/

```

## Prepare Inference Data

Hallo has a few simple requirements for input data:

For the source image:

1. It should be cropped into squares.
2. The face should be the main focus, making up 50%-70% of the image.
3. The face should be facing forward, with a rotation angle of less than 30Â° (no side profiles).

For the driving audio:

1. It must be in WAV format.
2. It must be in English since our training datasets are only in this language.
3. Ensure the vocals are clear; background music is acceptable.

We have provided some samples for your reference.

## Run inference

Simply to run the `scripts/inference.py` and pass `source_image` and `driving_audio` as input:

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --source_image examples/source_images/1.jpg --driving_audio examples/driving_audios/1.wav
```

Animation results will be saved as `${PROJECT_ROOT}/.cache/output.mp4` by default. You can pass `--output` to specify the output file name. You can find more examples for inference at [examples folder](https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/hallo/tree/main/examples).

For more options:

```shell
usage: inference.py [-h] [-c CONFIG] [--source_image SOURCE_IMAGE] [--driving_audio DRIVING_AUDIO] [--output OUTPUT] [--pose_weight POSE_WEIGHT]
                    [--face_weight FACE_WEIGHT] [--lip_weight LIP_WEIGHT] [--face_expand_ratio FACE_EXPAND_RATIO]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
  --source_image SOURCE_IMAGE
                        source image
  --driving_audio DRIVING_AUDIO
                        driving audio
  --output OUTPUT       output video file name
  --pose_weight POSE_WEIGHT
                        weight of pose
  --face_weight FACE_WEIGHT
                        weight of face
  --lip_weight LIP_WEIGHT
                        weight of lip
  --face_expand_ratio FACE_EXPAND_RATIO
                        face region
```

# Social Risks and Mitigations

The development of portrait image animation technologies driven by audio inputs poses social risks, such as the ethical implications of creating realistic portraits that could be misused for deepfakes. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish ethical guidelines and responsible use practices. Privacy and consent concerns also arise from using individuals' images and voices. Addressing these involves transparent data usage policies, informed consent, and safeguarding privacy rights. By addressing these risks and implementing mitigations, the research aims to ensure the responsible and ethical development of this technology.
